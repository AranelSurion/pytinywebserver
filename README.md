# pytinywebserver
##### Simple Python-based web server.

### Important note
This server was made with learning and fun in mind. Have a look at its code, improve it, rip it apart, maybe run it on your development environment, BUT do not, never, ever run this server on a public network. If anything, there's a high possibility of a path traversal vulnerability in this code as I didn't even try to prevent it.

You are warned.

### How to run
* Clone the repo.
* Run **python3 server.py**
* Root of this repo is the wwwroot of this server. Remove and copy resources as you see fit.
